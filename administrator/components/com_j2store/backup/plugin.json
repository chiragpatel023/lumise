It supports only the Entry views. Sobipro has lots of layouts and functionalities. If you need extensive integration with Sobipro, you might have to customise the integration with the help of a freelancer.\r\nThe integration can do the following:\r\n1. It will help you treat a Sobipro Entry as a product.\r\n2. It will help you show the folowing elements in the entry view: Price, quantity box, stock, sku, add to cart button.3. If the view \/ layout supports Joomla content plugin events, you can use the shortcodes to get additional data like up sells, cross-sells.\r\nWhile most components do support the plugin events in the layouts, some wont. If you see that the short codes are displayed as it is, then you can assume that the component does not support it.\r\nSobiPro comes with powerful features that can be used along with the integration.

It lets you define variations of a product where each variant may have a different attributes, e.g. SKU, price and stock level.\r\nLets suppose you want to add another option to your variable product which should not be treated as a variant.\r\nHere is the extension to fulfill such requirements.\r\nAdvanced Variable combines the features of Simple and the Variable product types. While you can create a few variants, you can also have other selectable product options that are not variants. Example, you can have the Size as the variant, while color can be a normal selectable option. That way you can manage the variants \/ combinations effortlessly.\r\nYou can create complex product options using the advanced variable product. Let us say, you are selling a ticket with two variants : Adult, Child. When customer purchases, you can take the Attendee name using a text box option. So when a customer chooses Adult, he will enter a name and add to cart. Similarly when the booking is made for a child.

Then click on the Cancel link.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do subscription renewals work?\r\nSubscriptions are renewed automatically.

They will have to be manually renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre auto-renewals enabled on my purchases?\r\nOnly if you purchased the following apps:\r\n\r\nQuickBooks Online\r\nSubscriptions and Memberships\r\n\r\nYou can review your renewal settings for these apps by visiting the Subscriptions tab in My Account -&gt; My Downloads.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill I be notified when my subscription is auto-renewed ?\r\nYes.
